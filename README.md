# React ATM

## Description
This is a simple ATM that can keep track of a user's balance when adding money through a deposit or taking money out through a cash back withdrawl.
This was based on an assignment in MITxPro's Professional Certificate in Coding, in which we set up the deposit and cash back functions and used useState() to keep track of the account balance. 

## My Improvements
- An alert to let the user know they have insufficient funds if the cash back amount is greater than the balance
- A transaction list, which adds a new role for each deposit/cash back with details about that transaction
- Enhanced CSS styling
